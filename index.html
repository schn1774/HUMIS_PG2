            <h1>MATTHEW BASSO |</h1> <p>Matt Basso, jointly appointed
            in History and Gender Studies, comes to the University
            of Utah from the University of Richmond where he was
            an Assistant Professor of History and American Studies specializing in 20th century political, social, and cultural
            history.  He received his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota’s Program in American Studies in 2001, his
            MA in history from the University of Montana in 1996, and taught in various roles at both those universities
            as well as in the U.S. Army <img src="HUMIS-WEB-HISTORY site image.jpg" height="597" width="516"/>while serving in Germany during the Gulf War. He retired as a Captain in 1994. Prior to his stint in uniform he spent four glorious years at Vassar College where his keen interest in gendered relations of power was born. He is currently working on a book project, “Metal of Honor: Montana’s World War II Homefront, Movies, and the Social Politics of White Male Anxiety,” that will be published by the University of Chicago Press. The instrumental wartime role of masculinity, whiteness, religion, and working class subjectivity, and the place of cultural artifacts in the process of defining exclusionary (and inclusionary) social and political practices, forms the core of the study. He is also the co-editor of Across the Great Divide: Cultures of Manhood in the U.S. West, (New York: Routledge, 2001), and is editing a lost Federal Writers’ Project Manuscript from the 1930s. He spent the 2003-2004 academic year in New Zealand as
            a Senior Fulbright Scholar beginning work on his next project: a comparative transnational exploration of racial and gender formations among Pacific settler societies (New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the U.S.).</p>
